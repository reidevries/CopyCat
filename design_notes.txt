Could use a Command pattern to abstract the control of characters. 
Could eventually replace message passing parser with Command pattern, 
leave it for now though because the current system is more flexible.


Entity:
	id
	name
	vector3 pos

Instead of message passing as it is now, can build into ECS
Each system update function can read and spit out messages
for more specific message related functions, implement a more specific system!
